Title: Diarmuid Lloyd's adhoc functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Diarmuid Lloyd
Maintainer: Diarmuid Lloyd <diarmuid.lloyd@gmail.com>
Description: A place for ad-hoc functions that I might want to reuse, or use regularly. Rather than have them spread through lots of .R files
    in different directories, potentially forgetting about them, it feels tidier to have them all in one spot, which also makes version control
    a bit easier. Could be overkill, and unlikely to be of much use to others...
